# ss-delta

A personal research project: a native PC port of **Soul Sacrifice Delta**
(PS Vita, PCSA00152, v1.30) by static recompilation, built from the owner's
own dump. It is a sibling of `<psp-project>` (Dissidia 012, PSP).

> **Private and non-distributed.** This repository contains *no* game data,
> *no* firmware and *no* code derived from the game. Everything is
> regenerated locally from the user's own dump. See [D2](docs/decisions.md).

## Status

Phase 0 (workspace, decryption, baseline) is done. Next is Phase 1: our own
Vita3K build, and fixing its Vulkan crash on this machine. See the
[plan](docs/03-plan.md).

## Documentation

| Doc | Contents |
|---|---|
| [01-research](docs/01-research.md) | prior work, the dump's structure, measurements of the 1.30 eboot, Vita3K as donor, approach options |
| [02-baseline](docs/02-baseline.md) | how the game behaves in Vita3K today, and how to re-run the baseline |
| [03-plan](docs/03-plan.md) | phases, exit criteria, risks |
| [decisions](docs/decisions.md) | decision log |
| [hashes](docs/hashes.md) | input hashes |

## Tools

| Script | What |
|---|---|
| `tools/velf.py` | Vita SCE ELF: segments, module_info, NID-named imports/exports, exidx |
| `tools/imix.py` | Capstone instruction-mix sweep over every exidx function |
| `tools/sfo.py` | print `param.sfo` fields |
| `tools/v3kdrive.py` | drive the portable Vita3K for baseline runs: launch, `BootSequence`, FPS sampling, background screenshots |

Python dependencies: `pyyaml`, `capstone`, `pycryptodome` (for SELF
decryption).
